# Firebase initializeApp Multiple Calls with Different Configurations

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur when using the Firebase JavaScript SDK.  If `initializeApp` is called multiple times with different configuration objects, unexpected behavior or errors may arise. This example illustrates the problem and provides a solution to avoid the issue.

## Problem
The Firebase SDK doesn't always explicitly throw a clear error when `initializeApp` is called multiple times with different configurations. Instead, it can lead to inconsistencies in how the app interacts with Firebase services. This is especially problematic when dealing with multiple modules or third-party libraries that attempt Firebase initialization.

## Solution
The best approach to avoid this issue is to ensure that `initializeApp` is called only once in your application.  Use a singleton pattern or a centralized initialization point to manage the Firebase configuration and prevent conflicts.
