The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the `initializeApp` function is called multiple times with different configurations. This can occur if multiple modules or components in your application are attempting to initialize Firebase independently.  The error might be masked and difficult to trace because it won't always cause an immediate crash. Instead, you might experience inconsistent behavior or unexpected data loss.
